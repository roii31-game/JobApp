This is a job search app which i created with the help of a Youtube tutorial

 
 - App gets data from a temporary API to show all the jobs with Icons, Description, Locations etc.
 - If you want to get the full experience from the API, create an account at rapidapi.com & follow this link         https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch
 - Just change my API key to your API key & everything will open just fine.
 - App has some small issues with the router part when you try to click on a job to watch the description (Still working on it)


Errors for now
 - App doesn't load Nearby Jobs & Popular Jobs because i've reached the rapidapi.com monthly limit of Requests



 - Run the app ----> npm start
